### Hey everyone :D
I'm a Computer Science undergrad from South West England, I am fluent in Python but I've also been learning Rust. Most of my GitHub repositories are personal projects for me to keep track of what I'm learning.  
I can be contacted by discord and email, for any reason. Come say hi!
